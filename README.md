# SPL-404

## What is the SPL-404 Token Standard?

**Think of SPL-404 as a hybrid token — it uses Solana’s Token22 standard to mint NFTs with an intrinsic token value.**

## How Does SPL-404 Combine DeFi and NFTs?

**SPL-404 combines DeFi and NFTs by enabling NFT assets to be more like traditional tokens.**

### Advantages of SPL-404

- **Ease of Trading**: With each NFT having a built-in token value, buying and selling become easier. You don't have to search for a specific buyer—just find someone interested in the token's worth.
  
- **Accessibility**: SPL-404 can lower the cost of entering the NFT market. Instead of buying a single expensive piece, you can participate at a level that suits your budget.

- **Flexible Use Cases**: This new standard opens up various possibilities. For example, in a game, an SPL-404 NFT might be an in-game item with a token value, making it easier to trade or sell when you no longer need it.

The SPL-404 standard makes NFTs more versatile and accessible, combining the best aspects of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).
